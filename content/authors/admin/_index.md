I'm Flora, a postdoctoral researcher in the [Environmental Physics Group](https://up.ethz.ch/) at [ETH Z端rich](https://ethz.ch/en.html), Switzerland. 
<br>

My work aims at better understanding the dynamic of acidity (low pH) **extreme events** in the ocean and of their **temporal evolution under climate change**. Besides the long-term evolution of these extreme events, I investigate their seasonal to decadal predictability. I use a **high-resolution regional ocean model** to conduct my investigations. 
<br>

Besides work, I am enjoying outdoor adventures, both at sea and in the mountains.
