I'm Flora, a postdoctoral researcher in the [Climate and Agriculture Group](https://www.agroscope.admin.ch/agroscope/en/home/about-us/organization/competence-divisions-strategic-research-divisions/agroecology-environment/climate-agriculture.html) at [Agroscope](https://www.agroscope.admin.ch/agroscope/en/home.html), Switzerland. 
<br>

My work aims at better characterizing and **quantifying the climate benefit of carbon farming solutions**. Via the calculation of **radiative forcing** (i.e., the change in energy balance at the top of the atmosphere due to a change in a driver of climate change, such as CO$_2$ atmospheric concentration), I aim at better accounting for possible non-permanency of carbon sequestration and trade-offs between greenhouse gas. 
<br>

Besides work, I am enjoying outdoor adventures, both at sea and in the mountains.
