title: Long-term changes in ocean acidity extreme events in the context of atmospheric CO$_2$ rise
summary: "Driven by the increase in atmospheric CO$_2$ the frequency and intensity of **ocean acidity extreme events** rapidly increase. In this project, which is also part of my PhD thesis, I quantified the spatially varying rates of increase in such extreme events in the last four decades. By gaining knowledge about past and present evolution, we also aim at better assessing **future changes**."

Driven by the increase in atmospheric CO$_2$ the frequency and intensity of **ocean acidity extreme events** rapidly increase. In this project, which is also part of my PhD thesis, I quantified the spatially varying rates of increase in such extreme events in the last four decades. By gaining knowledge about past and present evolution, we also aim at better assessing **future changes**.
