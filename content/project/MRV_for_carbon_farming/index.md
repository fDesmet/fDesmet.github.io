title: Monitoring, Reporting & Verification (MRV) systems for carbon farming (MARVIC)
summary: "I am involved in MARVIC, an EU SOIL MISSION project developing a **framework for the design of harmonized, context-specific MRV systems for carbon removals by agricultural activities**. In this project, my research focuses on the **climate benefit of carbon farming solutions**. I compute the **radiative forcing** of various carbon farming practices, with the aim of accounting for **possible non-permanency of carbon sequestration and trade-offs between greenhouse gas**."
