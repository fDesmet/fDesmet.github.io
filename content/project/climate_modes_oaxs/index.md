title: Interannual modulation by climatic modes
summary: "**Climatic modes**, such as the interannual El Niño Southern Oscillation and the decadal North Pacific Gyre Oscillation, modify the physics and biogeochemistry of the ocean on interannual and decadal timescales. In this project, I investigate **how climatic modes modulate** acidity extreme events. By better understanding these interactions, we aim at developing **seasonal to decadal forecast** for these events."

**Climatic modes**, such as the interannual El Niño Southern Oscillation and the decadal North Pacific Gyre Oscillation, modify the physics and biogeochemistry of the ocean on interannual and decadal timescales. In this project, I investigate **how climatic modes modulate** acidity extreme events. By better understanding these interactions, we aim at developing **seasonal to decadal forecast** for these events.
